A Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human-readable dates ("25th of June, 2009") into machine-readable dates ("2009-06-25"), using an attention model (one of the most sophisticated sequence-to-sequence models) with pre-attention Bi-LSTM and post-attention LSTM.
The model could be used to translate from one language to another, such as translating from English to Hindi. Just change the dataset for that and train the same model.
